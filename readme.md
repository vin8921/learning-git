Perfect 👍 You want to access your folder:

```
C:\Users\gerome\OneDrive\Desktop\git-folder
```

In **Git Bash**, Windows paths are written in **Unix style**:

* `C:\` → `/c/`
* Backslashes `\` → Forward slashes `/`

---

### ✅ Command to access your folder

```bash
cd /c/Users/gerome/OneDrive/Desktop/git-folder
```

---

### 📌 Step-by-step check

1. Open **Git Bash**.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   cd /c/Users/gerome/OneDrive/Desktop/git-folder
   ```
3. Confirm you’re inside:

   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

   👉 Should print:

   ```
   /c/Users/gerome/OneDrive/Desktop/git-folder
   ```
4. List files inside:

   ```bash
   ls
   ```

---

👉 Now you’re inside your folder in Git Bash. From here, you can run Git commands like:

```bash
git init
git status
```

---

⚡ Do you want me to also show you a **shortcut way** (dragging the folder into Git Bash to auto-fill the path)?


- mv is used to change the name of the folder by adding slash after the previous name

- mv is used for moving files by mentioning the files before ./ directory

- to create multiple files add the keyword touch 

eg: touch index.html style.css script.js


- ctrl + ~ => shortcut for terminal

## ✅ Simple Explanation of a Git Repository

A **Git repository (repo)** is like a **folder that Git is watching**.

* It stores all your project files **and** the complete history of changes you make to them.
* Think of it as a **time machine for your code** — you can go back to older versions, see who changed what, and work together with others safely.

---

### 📌 Example

1. You create a folder called `my-project`.

2. You run:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   👉 Now `my-project` becomes a **Git repository**.

3. Git will track changes:

   * Add a file → save a snapshot.
   * Edit a file → save another snapshot.
   * Delete a file → Git remembers that too.

---

### 🔑 Key Points

* **Repository = Project + History**
* Can be **local** (on your computer) or **remote** (on GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
* Lets you **collaborate** with others without losing work.

---

👉 Super short:
**A Git repository is a special folder where Git keeps both your project files and a history of all changes, so you can track, undo, and share your work.**

---

Do you want me to also explain the **difference between a local repo and a remote repo (GitHub)** with a small diagram?


- to make the repository use git init

## ✅ What is **master** in Git? (Simple Words)

* In Git, **master** is the **default branch name** that gets created when you make a new repository.
* A **branch** is like a **timeline of your project’s changes**.
* So, **master** is just the **main timeline** where all your commits (snapshots) go by default.

---

### 📌 Example:

1. You create a repo:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   👉 Git creates a branch called **master** automatically.

2. When you add files and commit:

   * They go into the **master branch** unless you create another branch.

---

### 🔑 Key Points:

* **master = default branch** (older naming convention).
* It’s usually the **main codebase** of your project.
* Nowadays, many platforms (like GitHub) use **`main`** instead of **`master`**, but they mean the same thing.

---

👉 Super short:
**In Git, `master` is just the default main branch where your project’s history starts.**

git add. means = adding all files

git -m "initial commit"

hello how are you


git log is used to check if any file is added to save.

to go in the past version - git checkout id ()

to go in the current version - git master
